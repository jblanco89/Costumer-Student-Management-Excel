# Costumer Student Management VBA-Excel
Excel-VBA application for customer or student management. This system includes a registration form where the most important data of the client is filled in while the sheet performs calculations such as the end date of the course or service (30 days) or the management of teacher payment (in the case of using it with students). It also includes an automatic filter for name, course, email, company, start and end date, and teacher. You just have to place the filtered data in any of the fields and press "enter". This application also has dynamic highlighting in the cells to make it more attractive.
Esta aplicación tambien cuenta con un resaltado dinámico en las celdas para hacerlo más llamativo.
